# Wave Function Collapse
## Overview
This project is a loose implementation of the Wave Function Collapse (Model Synthesis) algorithm in Java.
Currently, the program will use the variables found in various files throught the project to define the behavior of the algorithm. There is currently no way to pass a picture into the program and have it figure out the patterns to follow. 
When run, the program will generate a new window that contains the output of the program.
## Installation / Usage
Install the program and run WFC.java. 
If you want to change the parameters used to generate the values edit the variables in Value1.java through Value9.java. 
In order to change the size of the generated image edit the calls to the various solve methods in WFC.java. 
In order for logging to work you must have a file named log.txt included in your directory. 
In order for the data to be written to a file after execution you must have a file named data.txt included in your directory.
